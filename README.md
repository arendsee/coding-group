# Coding group

A repo for coding practice within our bioinformatics group.

# Goals

 * practice scripting in a bioinformatics context
 * gain experience in collaborative programming
 * learn version control through git/github
 * learn to automate retrieval of bioinformatics data
 * learn to develop modular workflows
 * find ways to test these workflows 
 * compare various workflow management systems
 * compare approaches to report generation

I am not focusing on any particular language.

# Approach

I'll post a problem every week, we can write our own solutions. Then we discuss
the solutions in the github issues section. This is not a graded class, so

 * do what you have time to do
 * incomplete solutions are fine (e.g. description of an approach, even if not
   implemented)
 * being wrong is good (better to catch problems here than in the wild)
 * be crazy, there are lots of unusual approaches we can explore

# What is good

There are many ways to do most things, so we will usually find different
solutions. But not all solutions are equal. A good solution should be correct,
robust, simple, and modular.

 1. Correct - Code should do what it is meant to do. Software development
    projects usually rely on tests to ensure the code is adequately correct.

 2. Robust - Scripts should minimize hard-coded values, reliance on unstable
    URLs, dependencies on unstable code, manual steps, or bad assumptions about
    the input data.

 3. Simple - Simple code is easy to read, easy to maintain, and less prone to
    bugs.

 4. Modular - Good workflows should be broken into independent pieces with
    well-defined inputs and outputs.

Better descriptions of good programming practice doubtless exist, and you are
all welcome to modify the above, but this suffices for now.
