Write a script to download the file: 

```
https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Alligator_sinensis/GFF/ref_ASM45574v1_scaffolds.gff3.gz
```

Think of this as a data entry point in a larger workflow.


Push your solution and a README describing your reasoning (if needed) into
a folder with your name on it, e.g.

```
├── _config.yml
├── problems
│   └── 1
│       ├── alice
│       │   ├── solution.sh
│       │   └── README.md
│       ├── bob
│       │   ├── solution.R
│       │   └── README.md
│       └── README.md
└── README.md
```

I will start new conversations about the results through the Github issues
page.

Since this week is finals week, and since this is the first problem, we might
not finish this within one week. If you want to talk about the problem, open
a github issue.
